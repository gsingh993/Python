#objects in python 
#python is a oop language, with infered classes like int and float 
#most important class/command is the assignment operator
#note the operators can not be numerals
#when using the assignment operator, the operator infers the type on element(float, int, string...)


#creating a new instance is known as instantiation 
#calling methods/classes
#a class is immutable if each object of that class has a fixed value upon instatiation 
#note a list is a muttable sequence of objects and tuples are not 

#list, tuple, and str classes are sequence types in python 

#list store a sequence of objects and is a referential structure
#here is and example of a list 

primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31]

#note that list can be changed 

#tuple class provides an immutable version of the sequence m8 
#here is an example of the same list as a tuple 

primesTuple = (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31)

#str class is special sequence that is meant for characters 
#to denote a string you can use either "" or ''
#note you do not have to use the newline for python string, all you need to do is add 3 ""
#here is an example of that

print("""python is great. 
Just accept it. 
Its the healthy thing to do""") 

#dict class -- dictionaries in python 
#essentially is keys assoc with values 
#here is an example of a literal declarion of a dictionary

dictionaryLiteral = {'Captain': 'Picard', 'Prof-X': 'Charles Xavier'}
